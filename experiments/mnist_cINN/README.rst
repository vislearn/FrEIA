(Simply download, and set ``load_file`` to the file location in ``config.py``)


Colorization on 'Color-MNIST'
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This folder also contains an additional experiment: 'color-MNIST'
(set ``colorize = True`` in ``config.py``)

The color-MNIST dataset contains color images, where each image is an MNIST digit,
colorized in a certain color scheme corresponding to the digit, with some random fluctuations.
The task is to generate color images, the condition is black and white.
The dataset can be generated by ``cd color_mnist_data; python color_mnist.py``.

The model uses a small conditioning network to extract semantic information (which digit) from the condition.
The conditioning network can also be pretrained by running ``python -m cond_net.py``.
